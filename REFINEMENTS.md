# TryOnAI Refinements - Validation Stage Polish

## Changes Implemented ✅

### 1. **"What This Is / What This Is Not" Section** ✅
- **Location**: After "Who This Is For"
- **Purpose**: Sets clear expectations for non-technical brand owners
- **Design**: Side-by-side card layout with check/x icons
- **Tone**: Neutral, professional, reduces ambiguity

**What This Is:**
- A visual try-on preview system
- Designed to improve purchase confidence
- Helps reduce returns

**What This Is Not:**
- Not a custom tailoring solution
- Not a size guarantee
- Not a replacement for size charts

---

### 2. **Strengthened "How Brands Integrate" Section** ✅
Added three clear promises at the top:
- ✓ Integration time: **under 15 minutes**
- ✓ No backend changes required
- ✓ Works via script or plugin

These are displayed prominently with check icons above the integration steps.

---

### 3. **Improved Demo Section Messaging** ✅
**Before**: "Interactive Demo Coming Soon"
**After**: "Interactive Demo"

**Subtitle changed from**: "This is a prototype demo to showcase the experience..."
**To**: "Prototype demo showcasing the intended experience. Final output may vary."

This sounds intentional and professional, not incomplete.

---

### 4. **Pricing Confirmation** ✅
Verified all pricing is in INR with proper labels:
- **Starter**: ₹2,999/month (200 try-ons) - "Best for pilots"
- **Growth**: ₹5,999/month (600 try-ons) - "Most Popular"
- **Pro**: ₹9,999/month (1,500 try-ons) - "Best for scaling brands"

Footer includes:
- "Cancel anytime"
- "No long-term contracts"
- "Usage-based pricing"

---

### 5. **CTA Copy Refinement** ✅
All CTAs updated to low-pressure, business-friendly language:

**Hero Section:**
- Primary: "Request Pilot" (was "Request Demo")
- Secondary: "See How It Works" (unchanged)

**Main CTA Section:**
- Primary: "Request Pilot"
- Secondary: "Talk to Us" (was "Contact Us")

Removed aggressive sales language, emphasizing collaboration and exploration.
